# WIWcloud

This is an SAP Fiori application that was developped in the SAP Cloud platform Web ide.

It should be deployed by registering it to a fiori launchpad.

The Who's who application just lets the user search for existing people, register new people and e-mail addresses, and delete them.
It fetches its data by consuming the OData service hosted in the cloud platform Hana database (project in the HANAXSEngineOData repo in this github account.)
